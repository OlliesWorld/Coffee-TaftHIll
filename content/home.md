  George: you ever think of running for class president? Thanks. That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house? What the hell is a gigawatt?


  Uh, Doc. Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.


  That's good advice, Marty. Nothing. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.
