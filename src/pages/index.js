              <p className="mb-0">
                Most of our horses live in 2 and 3 horse group pens. They are provided with free choice grass hay. We use Hayhuts to ensure the hay is fresh and all hay is fed in Hay Chix nets to monitor consumption. This system is ideal, because it allows horses to graze all day as nature intended. Free feeding also greatly cuts down on negative herd interactions. Our horses are very happy and safe in their group pens and we wouldn't allow it any other way.  We also have a limited number of individual runs on a controlled hay diet.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-0">
                In the summer and fall months we have approx. 3 acres of beautiful grass pasture turnout available to our boarders.  A rarity in Northern Colorado!
              </p>
              <p className="mb-0">
                At THA we offer both partial board and full board options/levels.  This is a big part of what makes our farm so appealing, as it helps accommodate a range of budgets.  It also allows you to be involved in your own horses care, if you choose to be.  Our Farm Managers oversee and care for all horses equally, whether they are partial or full board clients.
